# Research Journal

This directory is the project research journal.

- `roadmap.md`: high-level roadmap (questions, hypotheses, next experiments).
- Each experiment lives in its own subdirectory with:
  - `objective.md`
  - `proceedings.md`
  - `conclusions.md`

The journal should include the exact CLI command(s) needed to reproduce a run.
Those commands should reference scripts/configs that live in this repo (not `/tmp`).
