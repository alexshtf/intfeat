# Math Notes

This directory collects short, reusable math facts we use to reason about this project.

- `eigen_variational.md`: Rayleigh quotients, min-max principles, generalized eigenproblems.
- `graph_laplacians_and_discrete_sl.md`: weighted path-graph Laplacians (conductances), node weights, and the discrete SL generalized eigenproblem used in this repo.
- `tridiagonal_jacobi_notes.md`: basic facts about symmetric tridiagonals/Jacobi matrices that show up in 1D discrete SL.

When we learn something new (and it is reasonably standard / non-esoteric), add it here with short notes and references.
